# UAE Prayer Times Calendar Events Generator

A Python application that generates a **single `.ics` file** on a day or month basis with prayer times **fetched from the official UAE AWQAF Prayer Time and Locations API.** This single-setup, hassle-free solution allows Muslims in the UAE to **seamlessly import all adhan-to-iqamah and prayer time events** into their calendars with just **one** `.ics` file.

The `.ics` file is compatible with popular calendar platforms such as **Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and more**, ensuring easy integration without the need to import multiple files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xalifaaa/prayer-times-ics-generator.git

cd prayer-times-ics-generator
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Rename [config-example.json](config-example.json) to `config.json` and follow the instructions in the **Setup** section to set up UAE AWQAF API credentials:
```json
{
    "clientGuid": "your_client_guid",
    "clientSecret": "your_client_secret"
}
```

4. Rename [auth_token-example.json](auth_token-example.json) to `auth_token.json` in the project root for the program to store the authentication token:
```json
{
    "clientAccessToken": "your_Access_Token",
    "clientRefreshToken": "your_Refresh_Token",
    "refreshTokenExpiryTime": null
}
```

**Important**: Keep your `config.json` and `auth_token.json` files secure and never commit it to version control.

## Setup Guide
